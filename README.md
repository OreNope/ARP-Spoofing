# ARP-Spoofing
My implementation of the ARP Spoofing attack (aka ARP Cache Poisoning)

**for educational purposes only**

My implementation supports:
- ARP Spoofing via arp reply
- Storing to default `ARP Table` when to attack ends

### How To Use
arp-spoofer.py expects to get the ip address via command-line arguments in this order:

`python3 arp-spoofer.py [router_ip] [victim_ip]`
